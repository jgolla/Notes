* d3 upgrade process is in progress (v4.0)
* [Learnjsdata.com](http://learnjsdata.com/)
* Selections
   * similiar to jQuery selectors
   * selectors return array of array, important for sizing
   * use .node() to get native HTML DOM node
   * .call(selection) as an iterator over all DOM elements
* Data Binding
  * Data joins, one to one mapping
  * Terminology
    * entering - new data, doesnt exist on page
    * updating - data already on the page
    * exiting - data removed from page
  * .data method for binding array data to selections
    * the function passed in determines uniqueness
* Scales
  * .extent takes in array and returns hi and low
  * can use this in the scale method
  * domain is input, range is output?
* SVG
* Axes
  * d3 can create, but we must position

## Seeing Machines Think

## Everything is Seasonal
* [Zan Armstrong](http://twitter.com/zanstrong)
* [Slides](https://github.com/zanarmstrong/everything-is-seasonal)
* patterns tthat repeat over known fixed periods of time
* when considering time series seasonality matters
* consider the seasonality of causal factors
* baby data, day of week, week of year, month hour of day
* monthly aggregation is a bad idea, unless the data is inherently monthly (rent check)
* aggregate to time periods that make sense to your data
* sometimes seasonality is the story
* estimate the impact of seasonality when doing causal analysis
* decomposing a time series with STL
* Seasonalities are different for differnt people in different places

  * redesigned showing colored bars with indicator
  * when everything is good, thumbs up is fine, when things are bad they need the info
* Used table data for strings to create histogram to see the candence (useful for event frames?)
*![Table to histo](images/OpenVis2016/openvis3.jpg)

* [Article](https://medium.com/@uwdata/hypothetical-outcomes-plots-experiencing-the-uncertain-b9ea60d7c740#.sfjfd8ryv)
* Visualizations don't generally handle uncertainity
* Uncertainity visualization: reperesenting the possibly values that a quantity can take
* When they do, shown as box plots or error bars.
* Static plots (box, eror bar) Raise questions, but don't answer them
* Creating experience-able uncertainity
   1. Generate hypothetical samples
   1. Visualize (allow easy frame to frame comparison)
   1. Present
