  * The mere exposure effect
    * The more you see something, the more you will like it
    * Falling in love wih your own designs
  * Minimal Group Paradigm
    * Any group you are associated with, you are preferencial to
* Know your limits
* All methods are weak and strong
* Qualitative methods don't generalize or scale but provide rich feedback
* Surveys often happen too late, after the interaction is over
* Big data is descriptive, not explanatory
* What, how, why
  * Descriptive, explanatory, interpretive
* Not everything counted counts, and not everyting that counts is counted
* Always do multimethod research to help combat bias
* Becareful of over generalization

* Natalie Be'er (Huge)
* Regardless of how a user gets to a page, the navigation system should show them where they are
* For this reason, she hates the Hamburger (because it hides navigation)
* Assume every page is an entry page
* The homepage should focus on the features that are used the most and the content that the homepage user wants to see
* Don't take functionality away from the mobile version of websites
