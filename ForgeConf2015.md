  * Mint iPad app, data stays donut chart revolves
  * The paper app
  * CNN Money app

  * CNN App
    * Rotating landscape to portrait. The stories rotate and track
  * Target
    * Location aware dependent on whether or not you are in the store or near a store
* Designing a simple table video?
* When we over-simplify, we tend to miss important details.
* Need to do information architecture up front
* Most of our processes are feature-driven. Need to ask if the feature is worth it.
* Features are a way to market products, not to improve the experience. Need to sell the experience not the feature
* TED talk Why for marketing/selling apple
* Need to observe how people use the app
* Look for hacks. If your product is being maniplulated it is lacking something.
* Don Norman's definition of UX
  * UX extends past the edges of your screen.
* TODO: Mike Monteiro - not creation but destruction video
* A better use experience will always win over profit (target example, woudl it cut down on sales/impulse buys)

* Steps for designing "fun"
  * Define it
    * There are different definitions for everyone.
    * Need an operational definition
  * Rank it
    * How important is fun to the overall experience? 1 = essential, 2 = enhance, 3 = may improve, not significantly
  * Research it
    * Gauge user reactions of fun
  * Task it out
    * play, build, explore, create, etc
    * Don't distract
  * Test it
    * Non verbal clues are more important than verbal
